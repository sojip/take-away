# Restaurant Delivery App

This project was created for the TAKE AWAY's restaurant to process and validate online orders in real time by specifying the time required to prepare the order.

Done with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Firebase Firestore.

  - A user does not need to log in to place an order
  - A user can designate their delivery location on a map
  - The first time a user places an order, their information is saved in the browser's local storage and they do not need to enter it again
  - Orders are validated in real time
  - The payment solutions used are Orange Money and MTN Money which are electronic wallets
